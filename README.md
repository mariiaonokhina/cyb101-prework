## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app.
  
**Duolingo**

  1. Simple and aesthetically pleasing interface
  2. Drap-and-drop words to form sentences

**Instagram**

  1. Give thumbs up or hearts to messages
  2. Infinite scroll for reels
  3. Changing background color of the chats

**ChatGPT**
  1. Voice input feature
  2. Hold the response for options like reply, regenerate, "like", change model, etc


- Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not committing to this idea, but it helps to start brainstorming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.
  
I want to create a journaling app (like an electronic diary). I want to journal more but I'm always on the go and it's problematic to carry a notebook with me at all times. It would have password protection, tags like "daily", "family", "thoughts", etc.. Also, it would have simple text formatting options like making text bold or underline text, and the ability to upload pictures or videos. Also, I want to include timestamps, as well as the ability to search through the notes, and possibly even analyze them with AI. There are some apps like that in the AppStore but I don't like their interface or options, and I'd like to make my own.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- Xcode takes an insane amount of time to download, build and run the app.
